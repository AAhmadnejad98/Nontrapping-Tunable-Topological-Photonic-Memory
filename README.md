**Nontrapping Tunable Topological Photonic Memory**
This repository contains the implementation code, simulation scripts, and analysis tools for our paper "Nontrapping Tunable Topological Photonic Memory".

This work introduces a novel approach to optical memory based on dynamically controllable topological invariants instead of conventional photon trapping. Our system encodes information in Chern number states using a honeycomb lattice photonic crystal with magneto-optical properties, forming topologically protected edge states.
Key advantages of our approach include:

GHz-range write speeds (1-10 GHz)
Ultrafast read operations (~10 ps)
High energy efficiency (0.8 pJ/bit write, 0.0003 fJ/bit read)
Large topological bandgap (~10 meV) ensuring stable data retention
Robust fault tolerance (handling up to 15% structural variations)
Multi-bit encoding achieving 2.32 bits per cell via higher-order Chern numbers
